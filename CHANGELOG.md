## [9.0] - 2026

- Data-centric scripting: built-in JSON and FD data formats, native list / set / tree collections, bundled PCRE regex.
- Interpreter core (value model / objects / control flow), built-in runtime library, and 58 standard-library modules.
- Dual build: command-line `funcmd` and embeddable runtime `fun.dll`.
- Delphi 2006/2009 and Free Pascal cross-platform builds (Windows / Linux / ARM / WinCE).
- Companion IDE (`funide`) and example applications (`notepad--`, `odbc-search`, benchmarks).

> Note: this repository has a long pre-release history (back to 2010) that was not carried over into the open-source commits, so the changelog begins at the first open-source release.

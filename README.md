## Why Fun

In one sentence: **Fun is a scripting language that goes all the way from JSON to machine code.**

- One runtime spans the whole spectrum, from high-level data work (JSON/FD) down to low-level system programming (FFI, C at runtime, JIT, machine code);
- 58 standard-library modules written in Fun itself ship together as one embeddable `fun.dll`;
- in Xinchuang and AI-agent scenarios, it is the lightweight glue between domestic OSes, databases, chips, and business logic.

Fun is designed around a simple premise: **data and code should be equally first-class, and a script should be able to reach down to the machine without leaving the language.**

Most scripting languages either stay high-level (easy, but you hit a wall at the FFI) or force you to write C for performance-critical parts. Fun collapses that ladder into one runtime:

- Manipulate **JSON and FD** data with native list / set / tree collections;
- call arbitrary native code through a **compact FFI signature**;
- compile **C at runtime** with a bundled Tiny C Compiler;
- drop to **inline assembly / JIT** for the tightest loops;

all from pure script, in a single embeddable binary.

Fun is written in Pascal (Delphi / Free Pascal). The core is a small tree-walking interpreter with a dynamic value model, an object system, closures, and modules — deliberately compact so it can be embedded as `fun.dll` or run as a standalone `fun.exe`.

---

## Core features

- **Dynamic, data-centric value model** — numbers, strings, time, regex, and first-class collections: list (array), set, and tree, built on a variant-based runtime.
- **First-class functions** — anonymous functions, function references, currying, default and variadic parameters, and `->` pipelines.
- **Object system** — `class`, `this` / `base`, methods, and property get/set dispatch (methods, getters and setters are dispatched uniformly through the `.` operator).
- **Modules** — `use 'file.fun'` (optionally `as alias`) pulls in other scripts; the runtime tracks module state and dependencies.
- **Regex as a value type** — bundled PCRE engine with inline regex literals (`/.../`) and match operators (`=~`, `!~`).
- **Built-in data formats** — JSON and **FD**, a JSON-compatible, Markdown-like format friendly to humans and to AI (see [below](#the-fd-data-format)).
- **Runtime C & machine code** — bundled Tiny C Compiler, JIT, and inline assembly (see [the capability ladder](#the-capability-ladder)).
- **Compact FFI** — call DLL/shared-library functions with a terse signature string (see [FFI](#foreign-function-interface)).
- **Keyword aliasing** — a canonical English keyword set with pluggable alias packs (Chinese, French, custom) selected at runtime (see [below](#keyword-aliasing)).
- **Cross-platform** — Windows (32/64-bit), Linux, ARM, and Windows CE.
- **Dual distribution** — command-line `fun.exe` and embeddable runtime `fun.dll` exporting a simple `Run` interface.
- **Self-hosted standard library** — 58 modules written in Fun itself, from JSON/YAML/XML to ORM, async, UI, and native bindings.

## Quick start

Run a script:

```text
fun.exe <file.fun>            # run a script (.fun / .foo / .fxx)
fun.exe -v <file.fun>         # show compile & run timing
fun.exe -log[:log.txt] -gui   # log output / run in GUI mode
fun.exe -key:key_cn.ini       # load a keyword alias pack
```

Hello world (canonical keywords):

```fun
fun foo()
  ?. 'Hello, fun!';
end fun;

foo();

fun max(a, b)
  if a > b then
    result = a;
  else
    result = b;
  end if;
end fun;

?. max(1, 9);
?. max(9, 1);
```

Run:

```text
> fun.exe fun/demo/fun.fun
Hello, fun!
9
9
```

## A taste of Fun

Two quick, self-contained snippets that show both ends of the language (the full files live in `fun/demos/benchmarks/`).

Custom operators on classes, first-class functions, composition, and pipelines:

```fun
# a class with a custom operator
class Number(me)
  this['#'] = you -> (me + you) * me * you;
end class;
var $ = Number(2);
?. $ .# 3;            # (2 + 3) * 2 * 3 = 30

# first-class functions, composition & pipelines
var f = a -> a * 2;
var g = a -> a + 3;
?. g(f(1 + 2) + 3);   # 12
?. 1 + 2 | f + 3 | g; # 12 (same, pipelined)
```

A data pipeline that turns a query string into a map using regex and collection combinators:

```fun
use 'lib-regex.fun';
use 'lib-set.fun';
var q = 'a=1&b=2&c=';
var parseQuery = s -> (s | split(/&/) | map(sp_eq) | fromPairs);
?. parseQuery(q).@toJson(1);  # {"a":"1","b":"2","c":""}
```

See [`test-high-level-language.fun`](fun/demos/benchmarks/test-high-level-language.fun) for the complete version.

## The capability ladder

What makes Fun unusual is how far a script can go without a separate toolchain:

| Layer        | Facility                          | Backing                                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| High-level   | JSON / FD data, list / set / tree | native collections and parsers                  |
| Native calls | `dll.getapi(name, 'signature')`   | FFI with a compact signature convention         |
| C at runtime | `ccompile(code, ...)`             | bundled Tiny C Compiler (`libtcc.dll`)          |
| JIT          | `NewJit(...)`                     | dispatch between C (TCC) and assembly           |
| Machine code | `Assembly(code, ...).Load()`      | inline assembly, executable memory allocation   |

For example, `lib-tcc` loads `libtcc.dll` and exposes `tcc_new`, `tcc_compile_string`, `tcc_get_symbol`, ... so you can compile C source from a string and call the resulting symbol immediately. `lib-asm` allocates executable memory, writes machine code, and invokes it; `lib-jit` picks the right path based on the source (`#!c` → TCC, otherwise assembly).

A single script can mix both: `NewJit` compiles C **and** inline assembly at runtime, and each can call straight back into a Fun function (`@toCallback`). The snippet below sums `1..n` — once via assembly, once via compiled C — and hands the result to a Fun callback both times (full version: [`test-jit-cb.fun`](fun/demos/benchmarks/test-jit-cb.fun)):

```fun
use 'lib-jit.fun';
fun cb(a, b)          # a Fun callback called from JIT'd code
  result = a * 2^32 + b;
end fun;

# assembly path
var asm = `#!asm i:i
    mov ecx, dword ptr [esp+04]
    @sum1ton
    push eax
    push edx
    mov  eax, <test>
    call eax
`;
var jit = NewJit(asm, names: [test: cb.@toCallback(nil, 'ii:i', true)]);
?. jit.Run(100000);

# C path (compiled at runtime with bundled TCC)
var c = `#!C ii:i
  int sum(int n, int (*test)(int, int)) {
    long long s = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) s += i;
    test((int)(s >> 32), (int)(s & 0xFFFFFFFF));
    return 1;
  }
`;
jit = NewJit(c);
?. jit.call(100000, cb.@toCallback(nil, 'ii:C', true));
```

> **Platform note**: the `#!asm` block above is 32-bit x86 (Windows) assembly (`esp`-relative args, `ecx`). The `#!C` path is portable, but the assembly snippet is architecture-specific — on Linux/ARM use the C form or rewrite the assembly for the target ABI.

## The FD data format

FD is a data format designed to be **readable by humans and by AI**, and interoperable with JSON:

- JSON-compatible structure (nested keys, arrays);
- indentation-based, Markdown-like syntax;
- optional SSE compression;
- bidirectional conversion with JSON (`@toJson`, `getJson`).

```text
# FD format (Markdown-like: indentation + space-separated keys)
person
  name Zhang Weidong
  age 46
  skills
    - pascal
    - c
    - fun

# equivalent JSON
{"person": {"name": "Zhang Weidong", "age": 46, "skills": ["pascal", "c", "fun"]}}
```

Its defining trait is that **FD is self-describing**: the parser in `lib-fd.fun` is generated from a BNF grammar written in FD itself (`fd.bnf.fd`). The grammar file `src/parse/bnf/fun.ebnf` documents the language grammar in the same spirit.

---

## Foreign function interface

Fun exposes native functions through a compact **signature-string** convention. Examples drawn from the standard library:

```fun
'kernel32'.getapi('VirtualAlloc', 'iiii:i');  // 4 int args -> int
'tcc'.getapi('tcc_new', 'v:i');               // void arg -> int
```

The signature encodes each argument's type, then `:`, then the return type (`i` = int, `s` = string, `v` = void, `d` = double, etc.). The same mechanism drives COM (`lib-winole`), the Windows API (`lib-winapi`), and the C runtime.

---

## Keyword aliasing

The interpreter's canonical keywords are English (`fun`, `if`, `then`, `loop`, `class`, ...). Because keywords are resolved through an alias layer (`ParseAlias`), you can supply **pluggable alias packs** at startup:

```text
fun.exe -key:key_cn.ini   # Chinese keywords (函数=fun, 如果=if, ...)
fun.exe -key:key_fr.ini   # French keywords
```

Included packs: `key_cn.ini` (简体中文), `key_fr.ini` (français), and `key_pua.ini` (custom/private-use). The language itself is keyword-neutral — aliases are a localization/accessibility feature, not a different language.

---

## Embedding with fun.dll

`fun.dll` is the embeddable runtime for integrating Fun scripts into third-party applications:

```pascal
Run(PChar('script.fun'));  // compile the script
Run(scriptContent);        // execute it
Run(-1);                   // release
```

- **Free use (MIT)**: personal study, internal tools, and products released under an open-source license.
- **Commercial use**: embedding `fun.dll` in a closed-source commercial product (exe/dmg/apk or a SaaS backend) requires a commercial license — see [`LICENSE.dll`](LICENSE.dll).

## Building

The Fun core is Pascal; the source entry point is `src/prj/fun/funcmd.dpr`.

Toolchain locations are centralized in one file: [`src/prj/fun/setenv.bat`](src/prj/fun/setenv.bat). Edit it once to point at your installed Delphi / Free Pascal, or set the `FPC`, `DELPHI2006`, `DELPHI2009` environment variables beforehand — every `make-*.bat` script calls it and picks up the paths. Supported toolchains:

| Target                 | Script                                    | Toolchain      |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Windows 32-bit         | `src/prj/fun/make-2006.bat` / `-2009.bat` | Delphi 2006 / 2009 |
| Linux (i386)           | `make-linux.bat`                          | FPC 2.4.0      |
| Linux / ARM            | `make-arm-linux.bat`                      | FPC cross      |
| Windows 64-bit         | `make-win64.bat`                          | FPC cross      |
| Windows CE / ARM       | `make-wince.bat`                          | FPC cross      |

Building with `-DFunDll` produces the embeddable runtime `fun.dll`, which exports the `Run` interface. Build artifacts are covered by `.gitignore` and are not versioned.

The full grammar is defined in [`src/parse/bnf/fun.ebnf`](src/parse/bnf/fun.ebnf).

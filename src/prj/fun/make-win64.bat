rem -dWinAPI is intentionally absent: winapi.pas getapi() is 32-bit x86 stack
rem asm (esp-relative args) and does not compile for x86_64. Add it back only
rem together with an x64 getapi. -dWinCE/-dARM were spurious here too: -dWinCE
rem made 'host'.arg() report the OS as 'wince' on a Win64 build.
